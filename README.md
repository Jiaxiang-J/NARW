# NARW

This repo contains the code used for the analysis in "Machine learning for predicting North Atlantic Right Whale presence to support offshore wind energy development in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic". To view preliminary results, after cloning this repo, you can use the clean data.ipynb and model.ipynb to save the results and use Figure_NARW.ipynb to generate the figure. 

This is a work in progress, so changes and additional documentations are underway.

This work is part of the RIA Research Group, check other projects by [RIA-Research-Group](https://github.com/RIA-Research-Group).
